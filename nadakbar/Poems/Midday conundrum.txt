-- Midday Conundrum 

Sitting at my desk writing some casual CSS, little did i know it would be quite the pest. 

Overflow issues, positioning looking whack!, definitely think its time for a midday snack. 

Head in my hands look at this spaghetti code, perhaps i leave it be for a bit before the mind goes into overload.

Whats this!? a bug during compile how can this be with code that i thought was so versatle, 

Not to fear, my debugging skills are pretty amazing, 5 ....10......30 ..... 45 minutes later still debugging..... maybe should have held off on the self praising. 

Aha!!! a solution to the troubled code!, ...... really ...... nothing but a bug in node. 

where was my self promised snack from an hour ago. it was lost in the darkness of debugging code. 

Light bulb moment! to end all the woes..... How about i just delete ALL ........ OF ........THE ............CODE!!! 


- The End
